# Do NOT mess with this list unless you know what you're doing!
#  In this list, the commented out packages in the block directly
#     below are already installed in system-base, but the full list
#     can be installed on its own to make eopkg4-bin self-hosting
#     within a systemd-nspawn chroot command.

# When all packages in the list between the '# BEGIN' and '# END' lines
# are uncommented, the list below represents just enough OS to enable
# eopkg4-bin to run from _within_ the chroot and to confirm that the
# network is working + enabling https to work without system.base being
# installed.  Note that file and # zlib are prerequisites of eopkg4-bin.
# Otherwise, the list just represents the additional packages needed to
# confirm network connectivity when system.base _is_ installed.
